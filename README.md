# web-audio-composer
The idea behind this app is the give the user a GUI interface building Web Audio signal paths, in a similar way to how Pure Data works and Max for Live works. 

This is a very early stage prototype and have very limited functionality. But it can create simple signal pathes. You can add Oscillators and connect them by clicking on the output connecter and dragging to the input connector of the node you want to connec to. 

The current version has complex signal paths deactivated and all oscillators / filters etc are routed to the main master VCA.
